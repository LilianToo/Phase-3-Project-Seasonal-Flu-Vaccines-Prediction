# Phase-3-Project-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccines-Prediction
This is a binary classification project predicting seasonal flu vaccination using National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey Dataset

Introduction 

This project aims at developing a predictive model that estimates whether an individual received the seasonal flu vaccine using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. The dataset includes variables such as age, education,income,health status,healthcare access, and perceptions of vaccine safety and effectiveness.

The objective of this project is to answer the following key questions:

a). What is the Prediction Accuracy?

b). Which factors strongly influenced the uptake of the Seasonal flu vaccines?

c). Which groups of people are least likely to get vaccinated, and how can they be identified through predictive modeling?

d). How will the insights help in public health strategy?


In this project, we analyze and model data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving seasonal flu vaccinations during a pandemic. The objective is to generate actionable insights that can support public health decision-makers in optimizing vaccine allocation, improving distribution strategies, and targeting populations with lower predicted uptake.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 26707 survey responses with 36 features capturing the demographics,health behaviors, and other attributes. It provides two binary target variables (H1N1 vaccine uptake and Seasonal Flu vaccine Uptake). For this project my focus is on Seasonal Flu Vaccine Uptake.
The dataset is ideal for building classification models to understand and predict vaccination behavior.
